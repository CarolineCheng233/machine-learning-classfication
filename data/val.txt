Now on to the back: revealing but subtly so and perfectly shows off your assets without being ""in your face"" tight across the bottom. 

The only thing I would warn about is that the top does cut in quite a bit on the sides. I was able to wear a nubra and kept the dress from slipping too far in with a little strip of fashion tape. May not have been necessary but if you're planning to dance or move about, it's a nice bit of insurance. 

I usually wear a 2 in just about everything but went with the 0 for this because it just clung better all-around. Could have probably gone with an L (5' 3"" wearing 4"" heels) but I liked my shoes and didn't mind them peeking out with the R length.

I thought it made my hips look a lot larger than they are, and because it felt snug in the bust I did not wear a bra. I found out after moving around in it for about an hour (especially dancing) that the arms/bust loosen up. So I felt like I should have actually opted for the 10 in the end!  All in all, it was a very pretty color and the lace was lovely--just don't let the snug size fool you unless you can't zip it up or sit down in it-- it has some stretch in it. ",24,476873,160lbs,fit

The overall fit is definitely big.  I am usually a 14/16, but the 12 fit much better than the 14.  The 12 had a little pulling in the bust (and I'm fairly small busted for someone who wears 14/16 at 38C/40B), but the fit through the stomach/hips was too loose in the 14.  The zipper (down the left/strapless side) does pucker up some, but it was usually covered by my arm - and much less apparent in the better fitting 12 than in the loose 14.

Size 6 fit my torso and leg area better, but the size 8 fit my bust better, so I went with the size 8. This is pretty consistent with my regular sizing. 

I'm a 34 B, but breastfeeding - the dress seemed to accommodate my bust as it got gradually engorged during the night, so I think a C might work for this as well? I did not need a bra - there's some good boning in the bust area. 

One thing that may not be clear about the dress is that you will show some cleavage - it will just be covered by the lace. I didn't think it was too much, but someone looking for something a bit more conservative might. 

The dress was very comfortable - I was able to sit and dance without trouble. I think in order to make the bottom of the dress fit best, the wearer will need to be a bit on the curvy side - the dress on the model looks a bit like a shift, but there is room for curves that may appear baggy on someone who can pull off a shift dress (I can't).

The color is a bit more rich than it shows up on the model - it seems kind of pastel on the model, but it's a pretty rich cornflower blue - I think my pictures show that a bit better. ",16,1705471,138lbs,fit

I was disappointed to see when the dress arrived the bottom hem wasn't stitched. I wished RTR had checked this before they shipped it. The whole night the dress was dragging because of the hem but that was minor after I got the compliments. I would definitely use RTR again I loved the dress and the color!

There are terrific little bra strap holders and I taped the neckline of the dress to my bra - my normal everyday bra - so it wouldn't show if  I leaned forward.  Perfect.  The colors shown are accurate.  I reached a little beyond my comfort zone and, for a noon wedding luncheon at a restaurant, I was perfectly dressed.  I wore it with smashing purple suede pumps - the black in the dress is not quite black enough to match with other blacks - and the Ella Carter Kai earrings; a fine wool crepe blazer took care of the chill and it worked nicely with the ruched sheath.  I gave the dress only four stars because it was a bit frayed around the cap sleeves - loved the cap sleeves - and there were lots of long threads.

This dress is relatively demure, while still being fun and pretty. I generally wear a size 2 or 4 in well-made, RTR-quality dresses -- in this dress, I wore the 2. It was a little snug in the bust (my measurements are roughly 34-27-24... waist and hips weren't tight, but the bust was comparatively smaller), but workable. The 4 was loose throughout the body of the dress and, as a shift dress, wasn't terribly flattering in the larger size (overall, quite a different fit than the 2). There's no give in the dress, and the hidden zipper needs a buddy to get it all the way up! If you're larger-busted, I would size up; otherwise, veer to the smaller end of your standard size range (without undercutting). Another potential fit worry: I'm a little bulky in the shoulders/upper arms and am often worried about sleeves (even short ones) with no stretch, but this dress provided plenty of room there.

The only downsides, the fabric was a little thinner than I have experienced with other Nicole Miller dresses.  It was not lined so it will show more flaws than other lined dresses.

The blue is a lot more royal in tone than the model's picture shows, but the black lace tones it down to a more navy hue & makes it an appropriate dress for fall, winter or even early spring. The sleeves were not too tight on me at all, & I have broad shoulders. I found the lace to be a lot softer than I expected so the dress was really comfortable to wear. There's a slit in the back by your knees that provides a lot of mobility while busting a move on the dance floor. I am normally a size 6, so I ordered a 42, & one size up (44) for my back-up size. The 42 fit like a glove. Can't wait to rent this dress again! (By the way, I paired this dress with the Whiting & Davis Gold Mesh Glam Clutch, which I also highly recommend.)",12,1136949,140lbs,fit

I absolutely loved the color of this dress.  I also loved the ruffle going down the side of the dress, it was very flattering.  This dress does run true to size.  I am a size four and I am wearing a size four in the photo.  I do recommend going a size up for the backup size especially for curvier women.  The waist and the hips of the dress are not fitted.  The dress fits very comfortably throughout the midsection.  The fabric has no stretch.  The dress works best for cup size A-C.  I am a D cup and it was snug but not uncomfortable.  The dress can be worn with a standard bra.  I am 5’9” and the dress was mid-thigh length on me.  The dress would be perfect for a coattail party or any summer party.

The sequins on the dress have more of a matte finish so you won't look like a complete disco ball... but hey, nothing wrong with that! The fit of this dress runs small, however, it does have give in the thigh booty area, so if you're looking to accentuate those areas, this is the dress for you. 

Additionally, the sleeves are very tight which is what made me go up in dress size. Although the dress has give, their is very little to no give in the sleeve area. I would normally wear a Small, but for this dress I wore a Medium due to the sleeves being so tight.

Pros: Sparkly, Show stopper, Low Back, Long Sleeves for the cooler weather, Comfortable
Cons: The dress was so amazing, I got unwanted attention from men that I was not interested in. Ha! Another con about this dress is that is so gorgeous that another woman at the party I went to was wearing it. 

The ordering process was fast and easy and shipping was FREE because I am a PRO member. I received my dress the day before my event, got here right on time!

The gown fit me beautifully, and I definitely turned some heads. More importantly, I felt stunning. The sequins were just enough - not too flashy, but definitely caught the light. I loved the color, which enhanced the sequins to create a subtle shimmer & shine. The boned bodice gave the gown structure in the torso and made me feel comfortable enough forgo a bra. The gown had a certain easiness to it and draped well.


Don't get me wrong - I absolutely loved this dress, but there were some nitpicky details that bothered me. Though the gown is listed as ""lilac,"" the color looked more periwinkle - a little more blue than lilac - to me and can photograph as a very light color (see my pictures). Though it had a great fit, the gown was a touch too long for me, requiring me to wear 5"" heels. But I expected that as I am a shorter person. Additionally, on the gown I received, the lining was longer than the sequins layer, exposing the lining's serged hem. The serged hem contrasted against the clean hem of the sequins, and I wasn't the biggest fan of that. I'm pretty sure no one noticed, but it did bother me.

Overall, I would definitely rent this gown again (but I won't cause.. well, I wouldn't wear the same outfit twice *Thanks RTR for making this way of life more affordable). The things I did not like about the gown were not dealbreakers. The one thing I love most of all of this gown was how it made me feel!

I would say this is very true to size. I typically wear a 4 or 6 in dresses and had room to spare (especially in the bust). Other commented that it was small in the bust. I thought the opposite! I would also recommend for taller women - (any shorter than me and proportions would be wrong).
I had TONS of compliments all evening and felt so great wearing this for a sit down dinner all the way through dancing. My ONLY complaint is that for some reason the inner stretchy lining kept bunching at the bottom hem and the side zipper kept twisting to my back. Maybe it was my dancing?

First, I am only 5'2 and 110 lbs, so I know for taller ladies it is meant to hit the knee, and this size 0 went a little past on me; with 2 inch heels, the back part of the dress almost skimmed the ground. The 2nd concern was the weight of the fabric: this was an outdoor summer wedding, and the temps got into the 80s, so having an almost drapery like heavy fabric on was debatable. But I thought – go big or go home. This was a lavish Northeast late September outdoor wedding under a tent with dress code of cocktail attire. I was slightly overdressed as some were liberal with the dress code (pants?!), but I also got strangers saying how beautiful my dress was, even a group of guys who said I looked gorgeous in it! And the heavy fabric worked out later when it got chilly out, so I can easily see this as a fall dress also. I wore it with gold wedges since it was outdoors – strappy heels would work too, just stay with nude/gold/light colors, and minimalist. Black shoes just draw eyes to the feet, and that’s not where you want people looking. No necklace needed, just simple gold cuff bracelet and simple gold dangle pave earrings. Wear your hair up so everyone can see that sexy back. Yes, the straps do not sit flush on your back; when I needed to pose, I just lifted my shoulders up a bit and problem solved. The waist is a bit unforgiving, almost empire level, but the fabric hides that tummy pouch and no bra worked out fine. I wish I would have started my arms/shoulders workout sooner to maximize the look. I loved spinning on the dance floor in this dress – the photographer took a few pictures of me, and I was a plus one, not even a main guest.

After seeing many pictures of ladies looking absolutely gorgeous in it, regardless of body type, I pulled the trigger and ordered both a size 6 and a size 4. About a day prior to my dress arriving, I received an email from RTR saying that the size 4 couldn't be shipped due to unforeseen circumstances, but they had shipped another style in that size so that I could compare. I was secretly hoping that the size 6 would be perfect, but was so glad to have another option just in case!

When the dresses arrived, I first tried on the size 6 Erin Fetherston and it fit like a glove! The slip size was an 8, which fit terrifically, and the dress draped perfectly over my frame. I consider my shape to be a true pear, so I was more than thrilled that there was absolutely no snugness in the hips; the dress literally floated away from my hips  like it was tailored just for me. The waist was also true to size, and with a padded bra, I was able to fill out the top of the dress nicely without much extra fabric around the neckline. Overall, I think the size 4 would've probably also fit, but it may not have been as comfortable (other ladies reviewed the material as being irritating under the arms, though I didn't experience that in the size 6).  The material is absolutely beautiful; I thought it might be heavy in the summer heat, but I was able to dance the night away with no problems!

You'll likely read this about many other dresses reviewed (especially this one!), but I received so many compliments from strangers and friends alike! Probably the most compliments that I got on a dress other than my wedding day. It stands apart from the rest and you will feel like a million bucks!

I typically wear a 4/6 so I ordered the 6 and 8.  I tried on the 8 first and it fit.  (I wondered if  I had tried on the 6 though, how it would have fit.)   I am in a post-baby phase (baby is 6 months) so things don't fit like the normally do.  I typically wear a size 4 but my current body is a 6.  I  wanted something that would show off areas that looked good (my arms and upper torso) and this romper did not disappoint.   It was nice/snug fitting on the top. The bottoms had a little more space.  Jumpsuits are usually questionable from the backside and I thought this one fit better than most.  It was not tight, but did not give you that droopy but look either.  I did cuff the bottom of the pants so it fit at a desired length since I am only 5'4"".  Since this fabric was much heavier than I originally imagined, the cuff stayed put throughout the night. Overall felt confident. Happy with purchase.

The zipper was a bit tricky but my husband was able to get it up. I am 5 months postpartum so this definitely helped cover up the extra tummy pooch I'm still working on loosing. I definitely needed some fashion tape to enclose the girls a bit. The pockets are always an awesome addition to hold lipgloss and in my recent situation, bottles, pacifiers, etc ;).

This was my first experience  renting a dress. I ordered the Riza dress from Elizabeth and James as an option #1 but unfortunately a week before that arrived I received an email from RTR saying that the dress was not available and they were going to send me my second  option which was the lunai dress (same designer) in the picture.
Beyond the disappointing of not getting the dress that I ordered first I received in time and in absolute perfect condition my two other dresses.
I ordered a size 2 and a size 4 as a backup just in case. I wore the size 2.
The dress is true to size (but I'd agree with others reviews that says that the dress runs small) and the material was impeccable and also a little stretchy, very comfortable and perfect for a gorgeous wedding during Memorial Day weekend in St. Louis with almost 80 degrees . It was an elegant and chic choice and I got many compliments.
I also wore the beautiful earrings that I also order from RTR.

I did not hot have any issues with the slit hitting me too high as some others mentioned. I wore it with a bra which only has a small strap between the two cups and this gave me at least an inch and a half, maybe two inches before the opening would show. Even while setting down. 

Overall, I loves it! This has been one of my favorite recent rentals. I paired it with gold peep toe pumps with a little leopard detail over the toes. Oh and my Kate Spade Newspaper Clutch which always gets a lot of attention!  ",4,40031,125lbs,small

I had an instance where I had trouble getting into a car and sitting because of where the dress hit my legs.  For dancing, I sometimes had to pull it up because the placement of the slit and the length were not working together for me.  Once I was able to pull the dress up, I was fine- but, that was somewhat of an annoyance throughout the event.  I was worried that the slit might tear.  Also, the dress has boning and wasn't the LARGEST dress in the bust that I have ever worn (common issue for me), but I still had to wear a padded strapless bra to make the dress look nicer and more normal in the bust area.  The dress goes slightly lower in the back so while wearing the bra, I had to sometimes make sure that the back of the bra was covered and the dress was pulled up.  The dress had a sexy, but CLASSY, fit on me, overall, though.  ",4,1355017,115lbs,fit

It definitely runs small. I'm a firm 2, and ordered a 4 as a back-up based on other reviews. I didn't even bother trying on the 2. The 4 fit just right once we got the zipper up. The dress was snug all over EXCEPT at the bust. I didn't quite have enough assets to fill out the cups and the wire at the top beneath the shoulders was rolling down on both sides. I did have to do a bit of tugging throughout the night. There was no risk of flashing anyone, but I was definitely showing far more liner than the designer probably intended.

The dress material is pretty heavy, but if you have a belly at all, you may want to consider pulling on some shapewear.

It's a flattering dress, but I'm gun-shy about the brand's sizing now. I'll probably avoid BCBG/Max Azria dresses in the future.",8,1446075,106lbs,large

Great dress to wear to work. Tea length on a 5'6"" model, a little longer on me because I am 5'2"". I typically wear a size 10 so this dress was a little too tight for me, however, it is very true to size. I would suggest sizing up for the back up as I had difficulty zipping the size down. This style works best for A -C cup sizes as it is very fitted at the bust and there is no stretch to the fabric. This dress is very fitted at the natural waist and curvier women should consider sizing up by at least one size for comfortable room at the hips. This dress can be worn with any standard bra and would look amazing on an hourglass or petite figure! Pair with nude wedge booties! ",16,330793,,fit

PROS:
- Great color.  It looks orange on the site, but it's closer to a red.  I wore it for happy hour with friends on one of the sunny, warm days after 2 weeks of gloom.
- The fit is great.  If you can get away with not wearing a bra, do it.  I was originally going to wear one with it, but after seeing it was unflattering and it wasn't completely hidden, I decided to go without it and it looked better!
- It has pockets!

CONS:
- Depending on how you are built, the cut-outs may not be flattering for your shape if you are curvier because once the jumpsuit is zipped all the way up, it hugs the body.
- The fabric gets wrinkled easily, especially after sitting in the car driving.  
- I am only 5'1, wore this with 4"" nude wedges and it was still too long.  Wish this came in a petite size.

What you don't see from the photos is that the back lace is lined with a sheer skin color so its not completely open. You'll still see your skin but the light lining helps you feel safe that the lace won't rip. I originally ordered a 0L and a 2L but the 0 that rtr sent me was a regular so the slits fell really high up on my thigh and they were pulled open more so even standing ormally they were very prominent. The 2L was a little looser in the waist but not noticeably so. The slits fell lower down seeing that it was a long and they weren't pulled open as much so it look much more elegant when i walked and standing normally. The only thing is its difficult to maneuver going up stairs because when you pull one side up the middle piece still hangs so it looks a little awkward, you have to sot of grab a side and the middle piece and walk. And sitting it rides up a little but its not too bad.

I wore the 14, but it was a little big in the bust (a normal thing for me) and was a little long in the torso (also pretty normal for me), but not overly big.  I wish I had the 12 to compare.

So I made a quick decision to wear the L in the event that the M wouldn't fit. I do believe the M would have fit because the L was snug but roomy. I had a slight issue with the shoulders staying in place - they never once fell off but they could have been a bit more snug, I think having worn the M would have eliminated that problem. The length of the dress was great, it never rode up on me. Although, I would have preferred it a little shorter, and again, I think the M would have given me the length I wanted.

I finally figured out to have the dress delivered to me two days before my event in case the two sizes I requested did not fit.  I also sized up this time around.  And it's a good thing I did!  I rented this for a black-tie event at the art museum where I work.

I am 5'5"", 127 lbs, 34A.  I ordered in 4R and 6R.  I could not get the 4R to zip up.  All of these designer dresses are so tight in the rib cage!  But the 6R fit just right, thankfully!  It was slightly loose in the chest area, but I'm not very busty so that is usually what I expect.  I wore a black strapless bra and that worked just fine.  I also wore my usual comfy 3 inch heels and they worked perfectly with the length of this gown.

OK, now that the logistics are out of the way, let me tell you how much I LOVED this dress... and so did everyone else at the party!  I got tons of rave comments from guests.  It's very dramatic, stunning, and easy to wear.  The best part for me are the pockets.  Because this is a work event for me I have to have a dress with pockets for my work badge, keys, phone, business cards, and lip gloss.  I can't be messing around with a handbag.  The pockets worked like a charm.  And because this is a ball gown you can't tell I had all of these things in my pockets.

The fabric has a medium amount of stretch in it, so if it fits you more snugly, you'll still be able to move and sit down. I really liked this dress-- I liked the cut outs, of course, and also the way the neckline/sleeves were cut-- not cap sleeves, which I don't feel are that flattering for most women, but enough coverage on your shoulders and chest to keep it classy and keep you a little more protected when the temperature drops at night (the wedding was in San Diego and the October breeze coming off the Pacific was lovely but a little cold!).  Practical notes-- I didn't even try it with a bra, because I didn't want to have to be worrying about it showing through the cut outs all night, and used the Braza Reveal stickies to help keep my girls up in line with the darts built into the dress.

The midsection is fitted to show off your curves, but it is still comfortable. If you’re curvier, you may want to consider sizing up due to the fitted hip area. One thing that I love about this dress is the high low feature. The dress should be worn with NuBra or no bra. This dress is stunning and perfect for weddings, formal affairs and holidays. It would look best with black heels and gold accessories.

33.0,hourglass,32d,dress,"5' 8""",2958409,8.0,date,"February 15, 2016","So comfortable, classy, and warm!","The pictures show me in the size 2. This dress runs large - I normally wear a 6. I ended up wearing the 4 because the fabric has no stretch at all, and it really isn't for larger breasts. The white arrow shows how it smashes my chest. I have a small rib cage and was able to wear a regular bra even in the 2, but that might be an issue for others. The black arrow shows that the waist hit me on my ribs, much higher than my natural waist, and I'm short-torso-ed for being 5'8"". This made the 2 very snug, which is another reason I went with the 4, since the 4 hit about an inch lower (still pretty high).

In the second picture, you can see that the fabric would do a really good job of hiding a problem tummy (or postpartum fluffiness), but if you don't have this issue normally, it can make you look like you have gained a bit of weight.

I was able to wear this dress to church in the morning all the way through our Valentine's date at night. It was windy and about 30 degrees F; the thick fabric was nice and warm - probably wouldn't be a great dress for a hot day. The pockets were neat, but I didn't actually use them (except for when I put my hands in them for the first picture).

The dress is a beautiful color and looks good on probably any skin color. Fortunately, I just got back from the islands so a tan definitely will make it pop! I also paired the dress with nude nails/toes. 

My only complaint about this dress is that there no petite size. Also, dress is even more beautiful in person.",12,1407569,125lbs,fit

The only reason I didn't end up going with this dress was because it is shorter in the front allowing the feet to show with a longer train and I was looking for something floor length all the way around.  I know many people said to size down but I went with a 4 ( I normally wear a 2/4) and fit me well around the hips but as you can see it is a little baggy around the back and torso.  I can't say for sure whether a 2 would've been better but I would probably  recommend at least going down by 1 size  ,8,766579,130lbs,large

The pockets were a life saver as I didn't pack my clutch. 
Now onto the compliments. I wore this to a wedding where I knew 5 people out of 230 (two of which were the bride and groom). I would estimate at least 20 people came up to me and made an effort to compliment my dress. One lady talked to me for 15-20 mins about it and then later found me to take pictures of it, it sparked conversation with the father of the groom who I did not know, the waitstaff stopped me, and the compliments were equally male and female. Someone said it was the dress of the night and then I corrected them that the brides dress was the dress of the night. I honestly did not think this dress would be such a huge hit. 
 I would highly recommend this dress to all, especially if you are trying to make an impression. I will likely rent it again as it was extremely comfortable and easy to move in.  ",8,1166513,132lbs,small

First, it was an insane struggle to get the zipper to go past the seam separating the bust from the bottom of the dress. I'm talking, we tried pliers, we tried having my husband stand up on a chair and use some height to get it to pull, just everything ... I was sobbing. Now I was really in a predicament because it was a 2 o'clock wedding an hour away and the dress arrived around 11:30am. Definitely NO time to find a backup. Then my mom mentioned putting vaseline on the zipper and of course, it went right up. The boning in the bust was VERY uncomfortable and felt like it was stabbing me in the stomach all night.

As I walked it dragged behind me and it was fine, but for dancing I had to constantly hold it up and felt like I was always watching to make sure no one stepped on it.

Thanks to rent the runway I was able to have the most memorable dress of the night! Packaging was neatly organized, inside a specially designed RTR box lay my dress and the back up size (0L) and the earrings (Nicole Miller) I rented as well. All were neatly packaged and the return bag was included. I am 5'7"" and ordered the long. I was worried, from reading other reviews, that the dress would not cover my feet in my 3.5 inch heels because my shoes were silver and the dress is gold and that would look bad. However, it touched the ground perfectly. There is a teeny train which is perfect and accentuates the curves of a woman, even a woman as tiny as me. Close up, the dress looks cheap: you can see the mesh in between the sequins and I DID NOT like that look. However, from far away the dress looks like someone sewed bronze coins on the dress one by one. Regardless, whether far away or close up, the dress looks spectacular. I had to wear two strapless bras: one push up and one regular, because I left my cutlets at home. But the dress still fit fine (Im a 34C). The zipper is extremely difficult, so you would need someone to help you with that. I also found that even though I have a 6pack, I found it necessary to still suck in my stomach for a better appeal. I wanted to wear the 0L because it hugged my curves tighter, but there was not any room for my boobs to show a little cleavage. They looked like pancakes, even with one bra worn, so I had to go with the 2L. I did not experience itchy sequins scraping me like others mentioned, however there were times where the wires in the breast part dug into my ribs. It wasn't painful, but I just had to readjust the boobs so that the wires went back to their rightful place. Overall, I loved this dress, everyone wanted to steal it!

Cons: As others said, the zipper is TOUGH to get up, knowing that though, made me feel more comfortable telling my husband to really yank on it, and it did go up. And as others mentioned, the band around the middle isn't forgiving. I usually wear a 10-12 top, and I went with the 12 dress and was happy I did. It made it a little easier to get the zipper up and I did not feel constrained at all during the night.
Other: I was wearing ballet flats and the dress just floated above the floor, it was perfect.  I wasn't tripping on it, but it was definitely long enough. I think I could have easily worn shoes with a 1"" heel and been fine for length. I wore a standard bra with a clip on the back to make it ""racer back"" and it worked well.

It's sexy, but also conservative. It feels rich to the touch. The fabric is stretchy and thick, making it absolutely perfect for autumn, winter and spring weather. I wore it to an outdoor wedding in the rain, with temps in the 40s, and stayed pretty warm.  The dress got a lot of compliments. About the fit - I ordered a 2 because my usual 0 was sold out. But turned out this dress is actually true to size (despite some reviews). Yes, the satin band is tight on your ribcage, but it actually stretches a bit after a while. However, the lace top is intended to be tight (substituting for a bra) - and the size 2 ended up baggy on me in the chest area. How it fits you may depend on your bust size. If you're C-cup or below, order your usual size and one up. If your bust is larger, going up a size might be better (to get the looser satin band). Length -I'm 5""0' and it hit below the knees. Color - camera flashes make it look more purple/navy than it actually is - at night it appears fully black. Occasion - I wouldn't wear this dress for a girl's night out because it is on the conservative side (with my figure), but it's ideal for a formal affair - for a wedding it's perfection.

I was afraid it might be a little matronly, but it looked great, and I felt great in it. A quick word of warning, if you're going to have pictures taken you will absolutely want to wear a slip as the dress is a bit sheer.

The reason I'm not giving this dress the 5 stars it really deserves is that the particular dress I received from RTR was INCREDIBLY beat up. The ribbing was sticking out so the wires poked me all night, so while the dress itself was comfortable, it was actually somewhat painful to wear (though obviously it has nothing to do with the design of the dress). The plastic along the bust that's meant to help hold the dress up a bit was mostly worn away so that I had to sneak to the bathroom a few times to pull it up.

-I LOVED this dress. The cutout in the front gave me the illusion of the perfect amount of cleavage and the gold necklace made a necklace unnecessary. I just paired it with gold and black earrings and a bracelet. 
-The gold accent down the back was awesome. A nice additional detail to an already amazing silhouette. 
-I could wear a regular bra with this!! No strapless or razorback required.
-AMAZING FIT. I usually have problems with things being too tight around my bottom/hips while being too loose around my chest but this dress fit like a glove wasn't too tight or too loose. It hugged all the right places.
-Thick fabric with lining is always a plus while also not feeling heavy.

Cons:
This dress fell just short of touching the ground when I was barefoot. I knew this might be an issue from the reviews but at the time they only had 6R available. At 5'6"" I thought it was a little silly that a 6R was too short as I have never bought a ""long"" item in my life. I would have preferred a 6L. I had to run out last minute and get a pair of flats but lucked out with a pair of black leather flats with a gold accent that worked perfectly.

As other reviewers noted, the cap sleeves do restrict some arm movement a bit, but this goes the style.  I ordered the 6L and the 8L and one definitely showed some wear at the seam on the back of one of the sleeves due to the tightness, but otherwise in good condition.  I ended up not being able to wear this style in either size because of my own body type.  I am 5""9"", small bust, short-waisted (only an 1"" between the bottom of my ribcage and the top of my hip bone), and long-legged.  Due to my shorter waist, the hip area did not fall correctly so caught on the sides of my hips.  At first I thought wearing the 8L would correct this, but it also caught in the larger size and I then had such a gap at the lace insets there was a good 2"" gap between the dress and my back.  I tried pulling up the gown at the shoulder seams and voila, it hit correctly on my hips and the 6L would have been the right size for my torso.  There was no way to alter a rental, so i ended up wearing the second, back-up dress I had ordered.  It is a shame because the designer actually accommodated for having a butt with some clever seams at the end of the zipper, so this dress will drape beautifully...if you are not short-waisted like I am.  Length wise, the long was the right choice as I had planned on wearing 3"" platforms.

I wanted something that was soft, pretty and 'special', but not too formal or OTT. This was all of those things. The color is amazing - a gorgeous cornflower blue with touches of soft pinks, lilacs and slightly darker blues. And it photographs beautifully. 

The fit of the 0R was almost perfect. I am 5'6"", 32B bust and about 110 lbs. I can sometimes look a bit bottom-heavy as I have a narrow rib cage and small bust, but the draping at the top, the cinched-in waist, and the looser fit over the hips hid all that and gave me more of an hourglass shape. It was definitely more of a halter-neck style than I'd imagined from the online images, so I couldn't wear a regular bra without the straps showing, but a strapless one worked fine in the end. I wore the 0R and ordered the 2R as my backup size, but in hindsight, I wish I'd tried the 0P as this dress is super long.

The 2 would be too big everywhere except my chest - and I am not large chested - 32C - so this one will fit best for someone who is smaller than 35"" at the fullest part, 30"" at the band.

The fabric is very stretchy and comfortable too, and there is no zipper, so you can easily slide in it, which are added bonuses. Pair with simple heels and jewelry for an overall understated elegant look. It runs true to size, and it is great for any cup size. However, it is fitted throughout the sleeves and midsection, so I suggest sizing up for backup. It is stretchy in the hips, so curvy women need not size up. I am 5'4, and the sheath ended at my mid-thigh to knee. Wear with a strapless bra. This chic sheath works great for Hourglass, Pear, Petite, Full Bust, and Straight & Narrow figures.

The fabric is on the heavy side, which was great for my event because there was a bit of a breeze, but it wouldn't have been too hot even without that. The size 2 in this dress fit fine as well, but in the end I decided to wear the 4 to get a little bit more length (I had a small waist and bigger hips, so fitted dresses tend to be a little shorter on me) and because, let's be honest, I knew I was going to have a bit of a food baby by the end of the night, and I wanted to give it room! A couple of minor cons: zipping up the back can be tricky if you're doing it yourself. If you zip halfway up the back and then let go to grab the zipper from the top and pull it the rest of the way up, the zipper will unzip itself in that half second transition - it's just the nature of the material since it's so stretchy. If you do some arm contortions or enlist a zipper-helper, you're good. Also, it's tough to see in the photo, but there's some black contrast stitching in a V-shape on the front of the dress that extends from the neckline down the torso (it's decorative, not holding anything together).

The material of the dress is great though, not too heavy and easy to move around in, as you can see in one of my photos :) The only complaint I really have, which is minor, is I had to keep tucking the little strings which hold the dress on hangers in the dress. Overall, HIGHLY recommend this dress. ",16,385065,135lbs,small

I wore it with a black cardigan and 2"" black peep-toes; I'm 5'10"" and the back was just skimming the ground.  My only complaint for this dress was from the waistband and up.  The waist has no give, and I went a size up from what I normally wear just so I could feel comfortable dancing it in (it was for a wedding!)  However, the bust area was WAY too large on me, even though I'm fairly big up top to begin with (38DD.)  The sides gapped, and the shoulder straps hung loose; I used a handful of pins and fabric tape to try and keep everything covered.

Cons: Not many. A lot of customer reviews recommended sizing down, but the customer service associate I corresponded with suggested that true-to-size was accurate and sizing up was a better option. I never even tried on the backup size - the 2 fit almost like a glove. It was a little large in the waist, but it fit perfectly in the shoulders and bust, so I'm not sure sizing down to the 0 would have helped.

I didn't wear a bra with this because the back was a little lower than I thought, but the ladies were held in nicely. I am a 36D and wore the 10R and the bust probably couldn't have fit bigger ladies. Still comfy for me, though. 
Be careful that the heel of your shoe doesn't catch on the lace of the dress. It happened to me a a few times and I was able to shake it off. Just be careful. Also, the model (sz. 2, 5'10"") doesn't accurately reflect the length. It came below the knee for me and grazed the ground. This isn't as leggy as the picture makes it look.

I would add that you *can't* get into this dress by yourself, with the zipper falling where it does- but I managed to slip it on over my head, which is another reason why I wore the 10.

Pros: The quality of the dress is superb. I had many grandmothers asking if they could buy it for me when they found out I had rented it. The dress is sturdy but looks delicate, I wasn't worried at all about sitting on the lace or moving in it as it held everything in (as a bustier lady it was refreshing to feel good in a dress WITHOUT a bra.) The lace in the rump area features 3 snaps that joins the skirt seamlessly and hides the zipper, such a cute detail.
Cons: On the size 4 the hook/eye closure poked a bit as it had been warped a tad from previous wear. This is probably because the dress runs a little small.

What I didn't love, was that this is the first (and hopefully only) time Rent The Runway provided less than stellar service.  The dress was supposed to arrive on Thursday, but it did not.  Instead, I received a message that it would arrive on Friday.  Fine.  I'll roll with that.  So, Thursday, nearing the close of business, I note that the dress still had not shipped, so I called RTR.  The customer service representative was so incredibly rude and condescending.  I was concerned about fit, as I noted from the reviews that several people noted that it fit large.  So, basically she said that if it doesn't work, to call by 5pm on Friday and they could get me a new dress for Saturday.  Well, I work.  So i'm not sitting at home all day Friday to wait for a dress to arrive.  I was contacted on Friday by email, mid-morning, by a different RTR rep who informed me that only one of my sizes (the larger of the two) would ship.  That was so incredibly frustrating.  I finally asked about them sending the correct (and originally requested size), which they then offered to send the petite and a similar style in the size I originally requested.  It was just an exhausting experience and I was nervous that they wouldn't come through.  Thankfully they did, but only with two short hours to spare.  I'm not sure if I would trust them for a formal event again, especially in a case like this where I had nothing else in my closet to wear.  But, alas, the dress was perfect.

The shoulder straps were a hair long and kept slipping down off of my shoulders, but I wore a strapless bra underneath so it wasn't a big issue. The dress also has snaps inside the shoulder straps so if you are wearing a bra w/ straps, you can attach your bra straps to the dress' shoulder straps. The shape of this dress is great for curvy girls. It accentuates the décolletage beautifully, and the bubble skirt flaunts curves while hiding imperfections. The fabric is on the heavier side, and the structure of the dress really holds you in in all the right places. I would absolutely rent this dress again.",45,789745,204lbs,small

I ordered the 10 and the 12 since I still have post baby weight and I'm still nursing, so I'm a 36DD at the moment.  (I also have chubby arms and read that the lace wasn't very stretchy.)  

I wound up wearing the 10 since it fit me better up top.  As it was, I felt like the top was too long for me, but I'm usually a 6/8, so proportionately those would have fit better if I didn't have the extra lbs on me.  I didn't wear it for a long period of time, but if I had, I probably would have tried to pin the solid inside to my bra so that it didn't fall down.  The lace masked it, but I felt like I was tugging at the top a bit too much.  

I wore a strapless bra but with straps, haha.  The lower cut line of the bra worked better with the line of the dress.  It was nude color so it didn't really show although you could see it if you looked close, but it wasn't really obvious.  

The only negative was that my baby looooved the lace and kept grabbing at it!  I was petrified she was going to stick her little fingers through it, but it's pretty strong lace.  But really, the only thing that I didn't like was how my post partum body looked in it, which wasn't the fault of the dress!  It was slim but not too clingy and I liked how it was low cut but masked by the lace.  It's been awhile since I wore something this nice, so it was a fun experience!",20,1812341,150lbs,small

Beware of a $35 overnight fee if your dresses dont fit and there isnt enough time to ship another one reg. shipping. They replaced the dresses for two 6R. Returning it is easy.

The length was great 6R, I'm 5'2 and wore 5.5in heels (black peep toes) it swept the floor nicely and There was still a bit of room for me not to step on it as I walked. Its a little bit difficult to dance in, specially if you have to move backwards. It fit just a tiny bit big but nothing too bad. The rouching on the mid section is very flattering and Sequins camouflage less desirable areas. It has a tiny trail, which made it look so elegant. It was very uncomfortable all the way around the top edges since the sequins rub against your skin. I just ended up wearing a nice black cardigan most of the night and took it off a few times to show off the dress.

I absolutely loved wearing this dress; everyone kept saying how much they loved it. Def. felt like the best dressed! The pictures dont really do it justice. ADVISE - dont forget to factor in the height of your shoes if you want the dress to sweep the floor. It makes your silhouette look very nice. Make sure to order your dress way in advance as I struggled to find my size. Order your backup on a size down for a nice snug fit. The sequins make it heavy so it stretches a bit through the night. If you have sensitive skin this may not be a good choice if you don't want to wear a sweater most of the night. Wear a body suit it makes it very comfortable.

I loved this dress, but bustier women beware-- there's not a whole lot of room for your girls. I don't have a big bust, so this dress did wonders for me. The fabric doesn't give a whole lot, so be sure to size up one if you are especially curvy. My normal size is a 4, but I needed a size 6 for my hips (I'm a 27-inch waist). Overall, it's a great dress and I would definitely wear it again!

1) The color is amazing.  A blueish red, so it really compliments pale skin tones and even though it's red, it doesn't slap you in the face with the color.
2) The length -- I'm 5'3"", and the 40R brushed the ground in 4-inch heels.
3) The fit -- if you're unsure, size down.  The 42R ended up bunching really weirdly around the hips, and it just looked sloppy.  The 40R was very sleek.  If you're worried about problem areas, please don't -- the fabric is quite thick and it somehow hides everything and leaves a very polished silhouette.
Cons:
1) Wrinkles pretty easy, and arrived quite wrinkled
2)  The thing I took off a star for -- in the picture, you can see a little band around my midsection.  There's a piece of fabric on the inside of the top of the dress -- almost like a faux bra top?  But not thick enough that you couldn't wear a bra.  The edge of the fabric rolled up inside the dress and made an annoying little line that you could see through the fabric.  Considering this is supposed to be such a sleek dress, that little line of fabric really bugged me.

The dress is very form fitting in the torso but it has some texture to it so it does a great job of hiding any trouble spots. The neckline on this is absolutely gorgeous too. If I would have tried this dress on in the store I probably would have dropped the grand to own it. Very versatile and I will likely be renting it again!",21,565885,150lbs,large

The folded crew neck falls in a slight asymmetrical fashion while the back is open enough to remain office appropriate yet still bra friendly.

Running large, we recommend going one size down for backup. With no stretch in the fabric and a tighter fit in the bust, this dress is better for smaller cup sizes. The midsection is not fitted and with the fuller skirt this allows comfortable room for full hips. If you’re curvier, you may want to consider sizing true to size due to the fitted bust area. You can wear a NuBra or strapless bra with this dress because of the neckline and thin straps. My favorite part is the hi-low ruffle detail in the front. If you are taller, this dress would hit a little higher with the front ruffle. This dress is stunning and perfect for black-tie weddings, red carpet events and formal holiday affairs. It would look best with black heels and a statement clutch.

Fit: As other reviewers stated, the midsection is quite tight while the bust and top is loose. I'm a 36B and have a longer torso but there was still about an inch too much fabric in the top (seen as a little bit of bunching in the picture). I wore a strapless pushup because you could see the straps for my regular bra due to the looseness and to add a little bit. You really couldn't tell there was additional room up top unless I mentioned it so it ended up just fine! I absolutely loved the skirt. Perfect amount of flare but plenty of coverage. I'm 5'6"" so it hit me like the model in the photos. The colors are fantastic! Beautiful deep blue and the gold pops without being too glittery. The fabric is thick without being hot, though I probably wouldn't recommend it in the dead of summer. Definitely felt gorgeous in this!
Overall Fit: I chose ""runs small"" for two reasons. 1. The midsection is tight with a loose top but I would make the size up your back up size just in case. 2. As other reviewers have said, the RTR Italian to American conversions are off. I was originally going to rent the 46 with a 44 as a back up because that would have been an 8 and 6 according to RTR. Instead I checked conversion charts went with the 42 and the 44 (8 & 10 respectively). Granted, I had the 44 in my original order and would have been fine but by going with the 42 instead of the 46 I knew I wouldn't have wanted the larger size due to the amount of fabric up top.
Seriously, though, I would rent this dress again! The pockets were great (can't believe I haven't mentioned them till now!) and made walking around to meet and greet and also take part in the charity auction much easier.  And so many compliments! Just an overall good dress!",16,1078291,150lbs,fit

The dress is very well made, sometimes a sequined dress can look really cheap and the sequins will scratch your skin, fall off while you are wearing it, etc., but this dress has very high quality materials and is put together very well. I also loved that I could wear a normal bra with this dress - a total plus for me! The negatives for me were that I thought the shape of the dress and how the material drapes in the skirt really drew a lot of attention to my hips. If you have a pear shape then you know this is the last place we need more attention drawn to! Also, at 6 feet tall, the dress was just a teeny bit shorter than I would have liked but it worked.

The dress is quite long and large in the bodice. I knew any long dress would be too long for me given my height of 5'2, but I wasn't expecting this bodice to be so large. I lifted my arm up and almost completely slipped out. I probably have two or more inches that could be taken in. The dress is gorgeous! More of an electric blue than cobalt but still very vibrant.

FYI - I range from a 6 to 10 depending on type of clothing and brand. If you run larger because of your hips/tummy like me but have a smaller or average top half I'd size down for your back up.

10/7 Update - Hey y'all, so RTR did send me a 6 and it fit but it was tight in the bodice.

I actually ordered this dress after my first choice didn't work out (Carlos Miele ocean chiffon gown). My sister picked it out but I wasn't convinced that it was as pretty or a standout for my brother's wedding. Boy was I wrong! As soon as I put it on I knew this was the one (I know, sounds like I was shopping for a wedding dress). It looks even better in person. The chiffon material was flowy, and so comfortable. I danced for hours. I don't think I've danced like that since 1998. It was a little long so I had to hold it while I danced at times, but it was the exact look I was going for. I'm between 5'5 and 5'6. I like my long dresses to cover my feet and at least graze the ground. And I only had 2-inch heels on, because I wanted to be comfortable. So higher heels should do the trick if you don't want to drag it. Overall, I do think Badgley Mischka dresses run a little longer than most. This dress hugged me in all the right places from waist up, and then the rest just flowed. The fit is amazing and the color is beautiful. If you want to stand out in a sea of sameness, this is definitely the dress to wear! This dress made me extremely happy I wasn't a bridesmaid! So I could pick my own gown. Got so many compliments, but even if I didn't if wouldn't have mattered. I was in love! This dress made me feel beautiful, comfortable, fun, glam...all at once! I can't say enough. Like any strapless dress, you may have to pull it up once in a while, no big deal. I'm usually a size 6 but wore a 4; I lost a few pounds prior to this event. Though with this dress, I'd recommend renting a size down as backup anyway. It was so hard to part with it. I'd definitely rent it again...and again.
